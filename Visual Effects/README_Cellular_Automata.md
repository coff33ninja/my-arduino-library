## Memory Usage

**Warning:** This sketch consumes a significant amount of dynamic memory (RAM), using approximately 1953 bytes (95%) on a standard Arduino Nano. This leaves very little memory for local variables, which may lead to stability issues. I will optimize it to fit and work better on Uno and Nano devices, sometime, as I havent tested them yet.

- **Sketch Storage:** 9300 bytes (30%)
- **Global Variables:** 1953 bytes (95%)
- **Remaining RAM:** 95 bytes

Due to the high RAM usage, an **ESP32 or other microcontroller with more RAM is highly recommended** for a stable experience.

## Configuration Options

The following parameters can be easily customized at the top of the `.ino` file.

### Timing Settings
```cpp
#define SPEED_SLOW 500           // Slow update interval (ms)

## Installation

### Libraries Required
```cpp
#include <FastLED.h>    // For WS2812B LED control
```

### Setup Steps
1. Install the **FastLED** library via Arduino IDE's Library Manager
2. Wire all components according to the wiring diagram above
3. Upload the `Cellular_Automata.ino` sketch to your Arduino Nano
4. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) for rule information and generation tracking
5. Use control buttons to explore different cellular automata rules

## Troubleshooting

- **Simulation Not Starting**: Check serial output for initialization messages. Verify power supply capacity.
- **Buttons Not Responding**: Confirm button wiring and pull-up resistors. Code uses `INPUT_PULLUP` for internal pull-ups.
- **Pattern Not Evolving**: Some rules may reach stable states. Press reset button to generate new initial conditions.
- **Memory Issues**: Complex rules may challenge Arduino Uno memory. Consider Arduino Mega for extended features.
- **Speed Too Fast/Slow**: Use speed button to adjust or modify timing constants in code.

## Technical Features

### Efficient Memory Management
Dual-grid system for smooth state transitions:
```cpp
uint8_t currentGrid[ROWS][COLS];
uint8_t nextGrid[ROWS][COLS];
// Calculate next generation, then swap grids
```

### Toroidal Boundary Conditions
Wrapping edges create continuous world:
```cpp
// Wrap around edges for seamless topology
if (nx < 0) nx = COLS - 1;
if (nx >= COLS) nx = 0;
if (ny < 0) ny = ROWS - 1;
if (ny >= ROWS) ny = 0;
```

### Rule-Specific Color Systems
Visual distinction between different automata:
```cpp
// Each rule has unique 4-color palette
CRGB ruleColors[TOTAL_RULES][4] = {
  {CRGB::Black, CRGB::White, CRGB::Red, CRGB::Blue},    // Game of Life
  {CRGB::Black, CRGB::Yellow, CRGB::Orange, CRGB::Red}, // Rule 30
  // ... additional color schemes for each rule
};
```

### Pattern Placement System
Structured initial condition setup:
```cpp
void placePattern(Pattern& pattern, int startX, int startY) {
  for (int y = 0; y < pattern.height; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < pattern.width; x++) {
      // Place pattern data at specified grid location
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Customization

### Adding New Rules
1. Increment `TOTAL_RULES` constant
2. Add rule name to `ruleNames[]` array
3. Add color scheme to `ruleColors[]` array
4. Implement update function following existing pattern
5. Add case to `updateAutomata()` switch statement
6. Create appropriate seeding function

### Custom Color Schemes
Modify `ruleColors` array for different visual themes:
```cpp
// Example: High contrast scheme
{CRGB::Black, CRGB::White, CRGB::Red, CRGB::Blue}
// Example: Warm color scheme  
{CRGB::Black, CRGB::Orange, CRGB::Red, CRGB::Yellow}
```
